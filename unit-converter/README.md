Unit Converter
The Unit Converter is an easy-to-use and interactive web application built using Python and Streamlit. It is designed to allow users to seamlessly convert between common units of measurement, such as meters, kilometers, grams, and kilograms. With its simple and intuitive user interface, users can quickly convert values from one unit to another without the need for external tools or complicated formulas.

This project leverages Streamlit, a popular framework for building interactive web applications in Python, making it accessible directly in the browser without requiring complex configurations or installation of additional software. The app performs conversions using predefined factors and formulas, providing users with accurate results instantly.

Features:
Unit Conversion: Supports the conversion between:
Length: meters ↔ kilometers
Mass: grams ↔ kilograms
User-Friendly Interface:
Users can enter a numerical value to convert.
Select the unit to convert from and the unit to convert to from dropdown menus.
Instant conversion results displayed upon clicking the "Convert" button.
Interactive Feedback: The results are shown dynamically, allowing users to test multiple conversions in real-time.
Why this project?
This app was developed with the goal of providing a simple and accessible tool for unit conversions, catering to anyone who needs to perform quick, everyday conversions between standard units of measurement. Whether you're working in a scientific field, an engineer, a student, or simply need a fast solution for converting units, this app provides an efficient and user-friendly solution.

The app is designed to be expandable, with the potential for additional unit conversions to be added in the future. For example, temperature, time, or volume conversions could easily be incorporated as additional functionality.

Technologies Used:
