Unit Converter
A simple and intuitive unit converter built with Python, UV, and Streamlit. This tool allows users to convert between various units of measurement, such as length, weight, temperature, and more, in a user-friendly web interface.

Features
Easy-to-use Interface: Built with Streamlit for a seamless web experience.

Multiple Unit Conversions: Supports conversions for length, weight, temperature, and more.

Lightning-fast Setup: Uses UV for efficient dependency management.

Cross-platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher

UV (for dependency management)

Streamlit (for the web interface)

Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

1. Install UV
UV is a fast and lightweight Python package installer. Install it using the following commands:

Linux/macOS:

bash

curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
Windows:

powershell
Copy
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
Verify the installation:

bash
Copy
uv --version
2. Create and Initialize the Project
Initialize a new project using UV:

bash
Copy
uv init unit-converter
cd unit-converter
3. Install Streamlit
Streamlit is the framework used to build the web interface. Install it using UV:

bash
Copy
uv add streamlit
4. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the UV virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

Windows:

bash
Copy
.venv\Scripts\activate
Linux/macOS:

bash
Copy
source .venv/bin/activate
Running the Unit Converter
Once the setup is complete, run the unit converter using Streamlit:

bash
Copy
streamlit run unit_converter.py
This will start a local web server and open the application in your default browser.

Usage
Open the application in your browser.

Select the input unit and output unit from the dropdown menus.

Enter the value you want to convert.

The converted value will be displayed instantly.
